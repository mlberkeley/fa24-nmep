#### Lectures
Lectures are on Mondays, 8-10 pm @ AAPB 115, except common midterms (CS61ABC, 70, etc.) and holidays.

#### Attendance
Attendance is mandatory. If you absolutely cannot make it to lecture, please DM Tim or Tejas.

#### Homework
Throughout the semester, we'll be releasing homework that accompanies lectures. To subvert limitless extensions, we'll be implementing a hard extension policy requiring you to turn in homework **at most 4 days after the deadline**. This policy is for your benefit and will help you keep pace with the course!

We'll also be hosting weekly **homework parties** so you can ask questions and work with your fellow new members on the homework. (Details for times/locations for these will be released soon).

#### Projects
Towards the latter half of NMEP, you'll also be completing a project of your choosing with the help of mentors (older ML@B members). Project teams will be **3-4 people**, and there will be a final project showcase at the end of the semester so you can talk about the ✨cool✨ things you built/discovered!
